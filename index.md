# About

The OpenIGEM project is developing an open-source implementation of the IGEM model
of the US economy. Current work focuses the latest version of IGEM, which uses the 
North American Industry Classification System and is referred to as IGEM-NAICS to 
distinguish it from earlier versions which used the Standard Industrial Classification 
System. IGEM-NAICS divides the economy into 36 sectors and information about it is 
available in the "NAICS36 Model" section below.
